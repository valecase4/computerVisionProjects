# Shape Detection

## GUI for shape detection in Tkinter & OpenCV 

This GUI allows users to dynamically adjust the value of threshold for edge detection and view the resulting contours on a coins image.

- Use a slider built in Tkinter to adjust the threshold value for edge detection (particularly for canny algorithm application) in real-time
- Detect edges in the source image
- Find and draw contours and visualize them by drawing bounding rects around each contour (cv.approxPolyDP method)
- Build a Tkinter GUI to facilitate the user experience
