# Plot-Line distance calculator

## Program for calculating, given three points, the distance between the line passing through the first two points and the third point

This program is built with MatPlotLib Python framework

Features:
-  The program asks you to enter the coordinates for the three points
- The program visually represents the three points, the line passing through the first two points, the distance segment between the line equation and the point
- The program calculates the value of the distance from the line passing through the first two points to the point and shows this value in the graph legend
- The program is tested with Shapely Python framework
