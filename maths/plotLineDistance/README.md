# Plot-Line distance calculator

## Program for calculating, given three points, the distance between the line passing through the first two points and the third point

This program is built with MatPlotLib Python framework

Features:
-  The program asks you to enter the coordinates for the three points
- The program visually represents the three points, the line passing through the first two points, the distance segment between the line equation and the point
- The program calculates the value of the distance from the line passing through the first two points to the point and shows this value in the graph legend
- The program is tested with Shapely Python framework

Graphic Features:
- First two points are represented as red points
- Line passing through these two points is representend as a 
continuous red segment
- The third point is represented as blue point
- The line perpendicular to the red one (passing through the blue point) is represented in blue
- The intersection point between red line and blue one (containing the distance segment) is represented as green point
- The distance segment is represented as a 
continuous black segment
